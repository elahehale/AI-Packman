### Pac-Man AI Project

This project implements AI algorithms to enhance Pac-Man's gameplay, inspired by UC Berkeley's CS 188 Pac-Man AI Projects.

### Phases:

- **Search Algorithms**: A*, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find optimal paths.
- **Adversarial Search**: Expectimax and Minimax to create smart adversarial agents.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Allows Pac-Man to learn and improve strategies based on experience.
